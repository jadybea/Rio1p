## Code for calculating the position of ribosomes from transcription start site or stop codon based on NGS Ribosome Profiling Analysis


This analysis is part of the project on Rio1p directed by Yves Henry, Anthony Henras and Annie Mougin. mRNA fragments protected by ribosomes from yeast cells 

+ expressing Rio1p  
+ depleted of Rio1p 
+ or immunopurified using Nob1 as bait

were analysed by NGS Ribosome Profiling experiment. The R code used to determine the position of ribosomes relative to the start or stop codon of the corresponding mRNAs is deposited here.
